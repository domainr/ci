# domainr/ci Dockerfile
#
# We work in two steps: as root, then as not-root.
# We use two stages, so that we can --target=rootstage to do other work.
#
# Multi-stage Dockerfile requires Docker 17.05 or higher.

# Note:
# ARG goes out of scope on the next FROM line, so any ARGs wanted have to be
# repeated in the context where you want them.  However, there's special
# treatment for any ARG which is declared before the very first FROM: the
# values become the defaults for later ARG of the same name, and these ARGs
# (and _only_ these ones) are available for use in the FROM lines themselves.
#
# Also, note that LABELs persist across inheritance boundaries, unless
# overridden.

# Neat/Evil hack: while in CI, we use Docker-in-Docker, for local development
# it's nicer to bind-mount /var/run/docker.sock into the instance, so that
# you can run `docker ps` and see the outside docker.  The permissions and
# numeric ownership remain unchanged between the outside and inside.
# Using `docker-machine` (Boot2Docker version 18.02.0-ce), the socket is
# 0660 root:docker, where group docker is 100.  Assuming that we're derived
# from stretch (per default) group 100 is "users", which is _entirely_
# reasonable for the only runtime user to be a member of.  So go for it.
# Keep this as a comma-separated list of non-negative integers.
